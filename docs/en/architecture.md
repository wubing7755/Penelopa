# Penelopa Architecture

## Overview

Penelopa is a Blazor WebAssembly primitive alignment editor that consumes the
Atlas.Blazor 0.2.0 NuGet package for its dockable workspace shell. The editor
logic is layered so each concern is independently testable.

### Penelopa.Core

Pure domain logic with no UI or SkiaSharp dependency:

- `Primitives/` — `Primitive` base class and `Circle` / `Rectangle` / `Triangle`
  subclasses, each exposing an editable `PropValue` property bag (`Float`,
  `Double`, `Int`, `Uint`, `Bool`, `String`).
- `Primitives/ColorKeyManager` — maps a unique packed uint color key to each
  primitive for hit testing. Keys start at `0xFF000001` and wrap past
  `0xFF000000` (black is never a valid key).
- `Alignment/` — `AlignType` enum (Left/HCenter/Right/Top/VCenter/Bottom),
  `Box` (axis-aligned bounding box), `Transform`, and `AlignExtensions.Align`
  which moves all selected items so their alignment value matches the union
  bounding box. The operation is idempotent: already-aligned selections return
  false and nothing moves.
- `Services/IPrimitiveService` — collection + selection state shared across
  panels via DI (registered as a singleton).

### Penelopa.Rendering

SkiaSharp rendering extracted so hit-testing logic can be unit tested without
a browser:

- `CanvasRenderer` owns a draw bitmap and an off-screen hit bitmap sized to
  the render target reported by the host (`Render` receives the SKGLView
  `e.Info` size, so the canvas fills its host panel at any display DPI).
  Both bitmaps share one `ViewTransform` (y-flip world transform scaled by
  the device pixel ratio); `Render` clears both, paints every primitive
  (visible color on the draw bitmap, color key on the hit bitmap), then
  blits the result, draws the axis indicator, and draws the selection
  overlay (bounding box plus four corner handles at a fixed 8px screen
  size). The hit buffer is drawn without antialiasing so 1px edges stay
  hittable.
- `ViewTransform` maps world coordinates (model space, Y up, origin at the
  canvas center) to view pixels (Y down) at physical resolution: one world
  unit equals one CSS pixel at 100% zoom, so the render target is
  `devicePixelRatio` times the CSS size. It also carries the view zoom
  (wheel around the pointer) and pan (empty-space drag), so rendering, the
  selection overlay, and hit testing all follow the same transform. The
  color-key hit buffer indexes physical pixels, so a CSS pointer position
  maps through the same path that positioned the content at any zoom.
- `HitTest(cssX, cssY)` converts browser CSS coordinates through the shared
  `ViewTransform` and resolves the color-key pixel back to a primitive.

### Penelopa (WASM app)

- `PenelopaWorkspace.razor` hosts the workspace through the programmatic
  API: it builds the `AtlasWorkspaceDefinition` (via
  `PenelopaWorkspaceDefinition`) and passes the resulting `IAtlasWorkspace`
  to `AtlasWorkspaceHost` with `WorkspaceOwnership.External`, so the
  component owns disposal. The layout is a six-region workspace: an
  inline-start dock (Tools + Primitives over an empty lower slot), a central
  document group (Diagram), an inline-end dock (Properties over an empty
  lower slot), and a block-end dock with two empty slots. The left and right
  docks start at 300px each so the side panels are symmetric; the four empty
  groups stay collapsed and only keep their toolbar slots.
  `PenelopaTopToolbar` and `PenelopaStatusBar` are supplied through the
  `TopToolbarContent` / `StatusBarContent` host slots, and the four panels
  are registered through `ContentRoutes` using the kind constants in
  `PenelopaContentKinds`.
- `PenelopaWorkspaceDefinition.cs` builds the layout tree programmatically
  (`SplitNode` / `GroupNode` / `DockItem` arrays plus toolbar states),
  mirroring the declarative defaults: the inner dock splits and the bottom
  dock use a 0.5 proportional basis, the document group uses Scroll overflow
  with Adjacent activation, and the empty collapsed groups are persistent
  with no selected item.
- `CanvasPanel.razor` hosts the `SKGLView` (`EnableRenderLoop=true`,
  physical-resolution rendering via the default `IgnorePixelScaling=false`);
  the canvas element fills the viewport (no fixed content size), and the
  view itself is managed by `ViewTransform` zoom/pan: wheel zooms around
  the pointer, dragging empty space pans, and the Fit button
  (`renderer.FitToContent`) centers the content in the viewport, so
  scrollbars are no longer needed. It wires `OnPaintSurface` →
  `CanvasRenderer.Render` with the event's `e.Info` size and the current
  `devicePixelRatio`, plus `mousedown` → `HitTest` → selection (Ctrl-click
  appends). A small JS helper (`wwwroot/js/penelopa.js`) watches
  `devicePixelRatio` changes (matchMedia) so moves across displays with
  different DPI stay in sync, and hosts the pointer layer (capture,
  canvas-relative CSS coordinates, synthesized-mouse suppression, rAF
  throttling, wheel zoom) that reports semantic callbacks into the
  interaction controller. Browser `OffsetX/Y` are relative to the canvas
  element, so viewport changes do not affect hit testing.

### Containers and drill-down

`Container` (Core) groups children and applies an affine `LocalTransform` —
the A661-style rotation / offset / flip containers are factory variants of
the same type. The container has no visible shape; children render inside
its transform (`DrawNode` applies the matrix to both the visible and hit
canvases under a Save/Restore, so color-key hit testing matches what is
drawn). Children hold local coordinates; `Primitive.Translate` /
`SetBounds` / `ContainsWorldPoint` convert world input through the parent
chain (`Container.ToLocalVector` / `ToLocalPoint` / `ToLocalBounds`), so
dragging inside a rotated container follows the pointer and resizing keeps
the fixed corner anchored. The container's world box is the AABB of its
transformed children, so selection boxes and alignment work unchanged;
axis-aligned containers resize non-uniformly, rotated ones scale
uniformly to avoid matrix shear.

Drill-down selection (hit-through) collects the candidates at a point with
`CanvasRenderer.PickAll`: the topmost color-key primitive plus its ancestor
chain, ordered root → deepest leaf (the confirmed direction). The
`EditorInteractionController` starts each click at the outermost candidate
and advances the index on repeated clicks at the same spot (within 4 world
units and 500 ms), stopping at the deepest leaf; moving away or clicking
empty space resets the context. Ctrl-click skips drilling (append/toggle),
the tree panel selects any ancestor directly, and ESC cancels gestures.

### History and persistence

`PrimitiveService` owns a `DocumentHistory` (snapshot-based undo/redo).
A snapshot captures the primitive tree by reference plus every primitive's
property values, container children, and the selection; snapshots are taken
before each structural change (`Add`/`Remove`/`AddToContainer`) and before
each canvas gesture, so undo restores the pre-mutation state. Applying a
snapshot rebuilds the root list, restores values and children, re-registers
color keys, and re-selects by reference. Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z (or Ctrl+Y)
drive undo/redo through the pointer layer's key handling.

`DocumentSerializer` round-trips the document to JSON: primitives are
stored by type with their property values (color keys excluded — they are
rebuilt on load), containers nest their children, and the selection is
saved as primitive ids so it re-resolves against the rebuilt tree. The
Tools panel's Save/Load buttons persist the document to `localStorage`
(`penelopa.document`).

### Interaction

Editing gestures run through `EditorInteractionController` in Core — a
small state machine (Idle / Pressed / Dragging / Resizing) that receives
world-space pointer positions and a layered `HitTestResult`, snapshots
the selection and geometry at pointer-down, and notifies panels once on
commit. ESC, pointer-cancel, lost capture, or window blur restores the
snapshot and returns to Idle. Clicking an already-selected member of a
multi-selection defers the decision until pointer-up, so the same gesture
either collapses the selection (click) or drags the group; Ctrl-click
toggles membership. Resize keeps the corner opposite the dragged handle
fixed (`ResizeMath`, with a minimum size and mirror-flip when crossing
the fixed corner), and primitives fit themselves to the target bounds
through `SetBounds(bounds, anchor)`: circles keep their aspect with the
fixed corner on the boundary, triangles map their vertices by normalized
position. Future hit-through (drill-down) will collect candidates with
`ContainsWorldPoint` plus ancestor chains.
- `ToolPanel.razor` exposes Add (Circle/Rectangle/Triangle) and Align
  (six directions) actions.
- `PrimitiveTreePanel.razor` lists all primitives; clicking selects.
- `PropertyPanel.razor` renders the selected primitive's `PropValue` bag
  through the typed input components in `Panels/Props/`.

## Height Chain

Atlas workspaces are sized by their parent; the editor shell must chain
`html/body/#app/.penelopa-main/.penelopa-shell/.atlas-v2-workspace` to 100%
height (see `wwwroot/css/app.css`). The top toolbar and status bar render
inside the Atlas host, above and below the work area.

## Alignment Semantics

The six directions align against the **union** of the selected items'
bounding boxes:

| AlignType | Reference value | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| Left | `union.MinX` | `dx = ref.MinX - box.MinX` |
| HCenter | `union.CenterX` | `dx = ref.CenterX - box.CenterX` |
| Right | `union.MaxX` | `dx = ref.MaxX - box.MaxX` |
| Top | `union.MaxY` | `dy = ref.MaxY - box.MaxY` |
| VCenter | `union.CenterY` | `dy = ref.CenterY - box.CenterY` |
| Bottom | `union.MinY` | `dy = ref.MinY - box.MinY` |

Top/Bottom use MaxY/MinY because the canvas is y-flipped (screen y grows
down); the visible top edge is the larger world Y. Selection of fewer than
two items returns false without moving.

## Toolchain Notes

- `global.json` pins SDK 6.0.428. Building with SDK 10 triggers the
  RazorSourceGenerator incremental-input bug for net6.0 WASM, so the version
  is pinned.
- SkiaSharp is pinned to 2.88.9: the 4.x line's
  `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.WebAssembly.targets` requires net8.0+. The
  `SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux` package is referenced explicitly because
  2.88.9 only pulls Win32/macOS native assets transitively; without it the
  Linux CI tests fail with `DllNotFoundException: libSkiaSharp`.
- The `wasm-tools` workload is required to link the SkiaSharp native assets
  into the WASM build; CI installs it before restore.
- `NuGet.Config` maps every package to nuget.org
  (`packageSourceMapping`) so central package management (CPM) does not trip
  NU1507 on GitHub Actions runners, which add a default `library-packs`
  source.
